# ðŸ’Ž Diamond Price Prediction

This project involves exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling to estimate the price of diamonds based on their physical attributes. The goal is to understand key factors that influence pricing and build a regression model to predict diamond prices accurately.

## Aim
To explore the characteristics of diamonds and build a machine learning model to predict their market price.

## Goals
âœ… Perform EDA to identify trends and outliers in diamond pricing
âœ… Analyze the impact of features like carat, cut, color, and clarity
âœ… Visualize correlations and feature distributions
âœ… Build and evaluate regression models for price prediction
âœ… Provide a reusable notebook for interactive exploration

## ðŸ§  Project Workflow

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
          - Uncovered strong positive correlation between carat and price
          - Visualized feature distributions and outliers using histograms and box plots
          - Examined categorical features: cut, color, clarity
2. Feature Engineering:
          - Converted categorical variables to numeric using label encoding / one-hot encoding
          - Removed multicollinearity and scaled features
3. Model Building:
          - Trained models using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
          - Evaluated performance using RÂ², MAE, and RMSE
          - Random Forest achieved the best prediction performance

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights

- Carat is the most influential feature affecting price
- Diamonds with Ideal and Premium cuts are priced higher on average
- Color D and clarity IF (Internally Flawless) diamonds are the most valuable
- Predictive models performed best after scaling and encoding

## ðŸš€ Conclusion

This project provides a data-driven approach to diamond valuation. The model offers reliable price predictions based on quality attributes, supporting jewelers and marketplaces in pricing strategy and customer recommendations.
